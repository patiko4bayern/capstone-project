                                Only one player in Europe's top leagues managed 22 assists last season:
                                Thomas Müller has proven once again over the last 12 months how important he is for FC Bayern.
                                As well as his countless assists, the longest-serving player in the record champions' squad impressed again last term as a leader, team player, finisher (13 goals) and talisman.

                                It's time to get back to business as the new season approaches.
                                After the first Bayern players completed their obligatory medical
                                and performance tests at the weekend, a group including Sven Ulreich,
                                Dayot Upamecano and new signing Ryan Gravenberch finally took to the pitch
                                at Säbener Straße as the Bundesliga champions completed their first training
                                session of 2022/23 pre-season, although without some international players, who
                                have a few more days off after representing their countries in June.
